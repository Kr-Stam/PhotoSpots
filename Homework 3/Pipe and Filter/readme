This app works with user generated data according to the database schema which is located inside the diagram folder.
Because of that we cannot use an existing database, but we still have some static test data we use to initialize and test the application.
Later on when we fully implement the database, we will use the Pipe and Filter design pattern, we have already planned multiple filters.

Please note that the database schema, and some parts of the SRS and diagrams may be revised, in order to better organize team member responsibilities.
